This is a post about Mars, commonly referred to as the "Red Planet" because of its reddish appearance.

Some of my **favorite** facts about Mars are:

- Mars has two moons: Phobos and Deimos. they are irregularly shaped.
- Of all the planets in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like, due to the similar tilts of the two planets' rotational axes.
