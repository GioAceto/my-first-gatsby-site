This is a post about Venus, sometimes called Earth's "twin" or "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, and proximity to the Sun.

Some of my **favorite** facts about Venus are:

- Venus is named after the Roman God of beauty.
- Venus is the brightest object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon.
