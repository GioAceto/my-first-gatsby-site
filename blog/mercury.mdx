This is a post about Mercury, which is the _smallest_ planet in our solar system,
and closest planet to the sun.

Some of my **favorite** facts about Mercury are:

- Mercury has no moons
- Mercury has the shortest orbit around the sun of all the planets (87.97 Earth days)
- Geologists estimate that Mercury's core occupies 55% of its volume.
